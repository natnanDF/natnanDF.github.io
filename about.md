<h2>About me: </h2> 
My name is Natan Eliezer and I am a graduating senior at Champlain College. I am studying for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer and Digital Forensics. In addition to this I am also pursuing minors in Cyber Security and Criminal Justice. I have experience in advanced topics including but not limited to: Operating Systems Forensics, Malware Analysis, and Reverse Engineering. 

I have a deep passion for searching for hidden meaning in different data sources, looking to understand the inner mechanisms of malicious software. It is only though understanding that we can fully protect from the threats of today.

The pursuit of knowledge is something that I strive for every day. There is always more to learn and someone to learn from. I find my self researching emerging topics such as IoT and the cloud. Learning is something that is very important to me and in an ever changing field it is vital for everyone to grow.
